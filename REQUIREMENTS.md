## ðŸ“‹ General Requirements

- **Implemented using Django Framework** with PostgreSQL as the database service.
- Combines **Function-Based Views (FBV)** and **Class-Based Views (CBV)**, leveraging Django's generic CBVs extensively.
- Includes **more than 10 web pages** and **5+ templates**, ensuring proper use of template inheritance for code reusability.
- Extends the Django User model with a **Profile model** (1-to-1 relation) for additional fields beyond authentication.
- Implements other domain-specific models such as **Plant, Gift, Order, OrderItem, and ContactMessage**.
- Provides **5+ forms**, ensuring proper field validation and error messages for a good UX.
- Uses Django Template Engine with additional **JavaScript** for specific interactive features.
- Designed with **Bootstrap** and customized using **Sass** for styling. The design is fully responsive for improved UX.
- Implements **login/register/logout functionality**:
  - **Public pages** include: Landing page, lists (e.g., plants, gifts), detail pages, Contact Us, and a "Coming Soon" events page.
  - **Private pages** include: Admin and staff-specific stock management pages, profile management pages, shopping cart, and checkout.
- **Customized Admin Site**:
  - Superusers have **full CRUD functionalities**.
  - Staff have **restricted CRUD functionalities** (managed through roles and signals).
- Prevents unauthorized actions like deleting products tied to pending orders, or users tied to orders, etc.
- **Comprehensive exception handling and data validation**:
  - Validations occur at multiple levels (models, forms, admin, and views).
  - Appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.
- **Manages security**:
  - Prevents XSS, CSRF, and other vulnerabilities using Django's built-in mechanisms.
  - Makes use of uniquely generated slugs in URL patterns instead of exposing user IDs.
  - Additionally, implements custom form validators to prevent script injection by restricting special characters like < and > in user inputs.
- Adheres to OOP principles like **inheritance** and **abstraction**.
- Ensures **strong cohesion** through well-defined roles of classes, models, views, etc., and **loose coupling** through the use of mixins and abstraction.
