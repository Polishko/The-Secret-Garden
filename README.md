## Deployed App
[Visit the deployed app](https://thesecretgarden-bnf4g7hkcrdwajea.italynorth-01.azurewebsites.net/)
- For project evaluators: Please contact me at nalanbilgin@gmail.com for the superuser credentials that you can use on the deployed site! I will write you back in no time :) Otherwise you can install the project locally following the instructions below.

## **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### **1. Download the Code**
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_folder>
```

### **2. Set Up the Python Environment**
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

Install the required Python dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Install Node.js and Dependencies**
Make sure to have Node.js installed and then install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

### **4. Configure Environment Variables**
- Create a .env file.
- Paste the privately provided credentials
- Update the DB_HOST value based on your setup:
  -On Linux: Use the IP address of your host machine. Run ip addr show to find it.
  -On macOS/Windows: Use host.docker.internal. (if using  Docker)

### **5. Set Up the Database**
- Run migrations to create the database schema:
```
python manage.py migrate
```
- Populate the database with initial data:
- Copy the contents of the privately provided Pastebin link into a file named data.json (save it in the same directory as manage.py).
- Load the data:
```
python manage.py loaddata data.json
```
- This will populate the database with:
  -Sample products (flowers and gifts).
  -Predefined groups and their permissions.

### **6. Create Users**
Create a superuser to access the admin panel:
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
- Staff Users: Add staff users through the admin panel. When selecting their role, they will automatically be assigned to the correct group with the appropriate permissions.
- Customers: Customers can register directly through the applicationâ€™s registration page. They will automatically be assigned to the "Customer" group.

### **7. Run the Server**
```
python manage.py runserver
```
Notes:
- Admin Panel Permissions: Group permissions for the admin panel are assigned automatically based on roles.
- Frontend Permissions: These are managed separately using custom permission mixins.
